Vehicle License Plate Characters with Random Convolutional Networks
===================================================================

This directory contains links to:
- the source and binary code (code)
- the dataset of the vehicle license plate characters (img-plates & img-chars)

used to run the methodology described and the experiments reported in:

D. Menotti, G. Chiachia, A. X. Falc√£o, V. J. Oliviera Neto, "Vehicle License Plate Recognition With Random Convolutional Networks", in IEEE Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI), 2014, Rio de Janeiro-Brazil.
(a URL to the slides used for presentation of the work in SIBGRAPI 2014 can also be found in this directory)

Download the entire data (data), extract it to any directory and just run "make" from it.
The source code was developed, evaluated, and run under Linux Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bits.

MATLAB (2010 or newer - developed on 2012a) is required to run some scripts to generate chars from plates and to plot statistic graphics, but it is not essential ro tun the experiments (i.e., the random optimization)
